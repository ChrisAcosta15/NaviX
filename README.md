 AuburnHacks 2020 Map Expo App Submission; Runner-Up
 Using Android Studio and with code written in Java, my team and I worked to 
 develop the foundations of a mobile application that would act as an interactive map
 for participants of any expo style event, as well as adding the ability for corporate
 attendees to update their stand with their company information. The final and least functional 
 part of the app in its current state is for organizers to create their own custom
 interactive maps.
